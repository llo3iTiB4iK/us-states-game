# us-states-game
This is my mini-project, created while going through the 100 Days of Code Python Course. The game's goal is to name all the 50 States of America. Program is using turtle library for GUI and pandas for easy work with input 50_states.csv (states data). For visualization, USA map is in blank_states_image.gif file. Game can be paused and resumed later.
